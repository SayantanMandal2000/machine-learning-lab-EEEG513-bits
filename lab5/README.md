# Decision Tree Classifiers on Iris and Wine Datasets

This repository contains the code and results for **Lab Assignment 5** of the  
**Machine Learning for Electronics Engineers Lab**.  

The project demonstrates the implementation of **Decision Tree classifiers** using Python's **scikit-learn** library on two well-known datasets: **Iris** and **Wine**.

## üìå Project Overview
The primary objective of this lab is to **build, visualize, and test Decision Tree models** for multi-class classification tasks.  
The notebook covers two distinct classification problems:

1. **Iris Flower Classification** ‚Äì Classify species of iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements using the **Gini Impurity** criterion.  
2. **Wine Classification** ‚Äì Classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties using the **Entropy** criterion.

## üå∏ Task 1: Iris Dataset Classification

**Objective:**  
Classify iris flowers into one of three species (*setosa, versicolor, virginica*).

- **Dataset:** Iris (from `sklearn.datasets`)  
- **Predictor Variables:**  
  `['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']`  
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Split Criterion:** Gini Impurity  

### üîπ Decision Tree Visualization (Gini Impurity)
A decision tree was generated by training the classifier on the **entire Iris dataset**.

### üîπ Model Prediction
The trained model was tested with a sample data point `[5, 3.5, 1.3, 0.3]`.

- **Predicted Class (Numeric):** 0  
- **Predicted Class (Species):** *setosa*

## üç∑ Task 2: Wine Dataset Classification

**Objective:**  
Classify wines into one of three classes based on their chemical attributes.

- **Dataset:** Wine (from `sklearn.datasets`)  
- **Predictor Variables:**  
  `['alcohol', 'malic_acid', 'ash', 'alcalinity_of_ash', 'magnesium', 'total_phenols', 'flavanoids', 'nonflavanoid_phenols', 'proanthocyanins', 'color_intensity', 'hue', 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines', 'proline']`  
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Split Criterion:** Entropy  

### üîπ Decision Tree Visualization (Entropy)
A decision tree was generated by training the classifier on the **entire Wine dataset**.
